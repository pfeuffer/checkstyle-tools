This repo contains small tools, to support your work with the results of
checkstyle in java. These tools will read the checkstyle result files.

1. CheckstyleSum
   This will sum up either the error count per java file or the overall count of
   each file. Doing so, you have a good overview what your errors are and where
   to start cleaning up.
2. CheckstyleSuppressions
   If you take over an existing project with lots of code and you want to
   introduce checkstyle, but the existing code has so much errors so that you
   cannot focus on you new code amidst all the existing warnings, this can
   help you. It will read the checkstyle results and create a suppression file,
   that will suppress all the existing errors. Thereafter you will find only
   new errors introduced due to changes.
